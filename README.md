## General view

### The challenge

Ebytr To-Do list is a project that creates a task list, where a user can create and log in in their account, and manipulate their tasks.

**The users must be capable of**

- Register and authenticate themselves
- Create tasks
- Sort tasks by title, date of creation, and status
- Update tasks
- Delete tasks

### Lessons learned

In this project I could improve my knowledge in both front-end and back-end, by:

- Using and learning about new libraries and frameworks and its applicabilities.
- Using docker and docker-compose to create two separate environments, one for development, and one for testing.
- Creating a fake database to make end to end tests.
- Fetching the backend using Redux toolkit async actions.
